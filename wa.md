# Working Agreement

## 1. Purpose
This Working Agreement outlines the expectations and responsibilities of all developers involved in BTS530 - **Group 17** as detailed in **README.md**.

## 2. Communications
#### **Contact/Discussions**
- The primary source of communications will be held in our Discord Group Chat. All members must respond in a reasonable amount of time (24 hours).

#### **Group meetings**
- All meetings will be held on either Monday, Saturday, or Sunday (Times are subject to change)
- All meetings with Marcel will happen at **Friday 10:00 AM EST** depending on course schedule.

## 3. Missed Meetings / Deadlines
- If a member is to miss a meeting or deadline, he/she is to inform the rest of the group within a reasonable time frame (24 hours) to make the proper adjustments.
- Member is exempt from penalization if it is an emergency
- A member may be subject to increased work-load for missed work
- A warning will be provided for only the first offense, otherwise the instructor may be informed of poor punctuality.

## 4. Coding Practices
- All developers must be informed before any Database schema change happens.
- All developers will pull regularly from `'main'` branch to catch conflicts that may arise early.
- All developers will be working on their own branch assigned to an issue. This issue is to be closed when a PR is merged into the `main` branch
- Follow [Google Guidelines](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html) under **Section 5 Naming**

## 5. Quality
If work for a given requirement is not deemed as satisfactory by other group members, a suggestion must be made and agreed upon and the person(s) responsible for improving their work before the next meeting.

## 6. Dispute Resolution
Any disputes between two members may be overturned by another member if given sufficient reasoning. If a result cannot be achieved, a coin flip will determine the decision.

## 7. Termination
If there is an excessive amount of work responsibilities not being fulfilled, they will be subject to removal from the group by Marcel.
