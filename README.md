## Project Description


In this project, this website will be tailored for customers shopping on a website. This website will feature all the tools that you need in order to purchase items online regardless of the type of items that will be for sale on the website. This project will have a fully complete “template” in order to create a fully functioning website that will allow you  to buy items of any kind depending on the type of shop that you would like to create.

### Admin CRUD functionalities for Products on website

This tool will allow you to have all the functionality that you need in order to add, remove, and edit products into the shop. This will give the user all that they need to edit their website in any way. This will remove the need to consistently contact the developers. This will also make it incredibly easy to update the website in an effortless and smooth manner.

### Cart

We will be creating a cart function so users can buy multiple items at once. 

### Payment Portal

This will be the tool that allows the website in order to receive payments. We will be using Stripe which is generally considered the industry standard. 

### Order Tracking 

This will  organise all the orders and payments to be able to keep track of every single order on the website. We will be using Stripe which is generally considered the industry standard. 

## Tech Stack

### Back-End
 PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM with Firebase, Express 

The back-end will use a cloud-based PostgreSQL database from [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). Data will then be fetched in an intuitive way using [Prisma](https://prisma.io/).
Firebase also has it'/s own NoSql database called Firestore which may be used to run the entire application. 

### Front-End

NextJS, React, TailwindCSS
The front-end UI will be developed using a NextJS framework, and all styling will be using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to develop the main interface. The template websites will have their css stored separately and themes will be held via a json file.

### Developing Tools

This website was developed using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Typescript,Prisma extensions. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) will be used to test all API routes from our application. Stripe services will be used for all transactional based actions. [Github](https://www.github.com/) will be our primary source of code collaboration.

### Theme

We will be choosing a theme for this templated project which will use mock data, for products. We plan on creating a clothing store.
